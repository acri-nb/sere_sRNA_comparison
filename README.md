**#SERE for RNA-Seq**

**Description**

Simple Error Ratio Estimate (SERE) is a statistical tool used to quantify and visualize global differences between two or more sets of RNA-seq count data. Analysis of SERE scores and dendrograms help effectively determine the reliability of experimental replicates. 

**Considerations**

The majority of this script (including the SERE score and SERE dendrogram portions) was developed by https://github.com/eigenv/SERE
